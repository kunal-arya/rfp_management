## ü§ñ AI Usage Report

This project was developed with substantial AI assistance, highlighting effective human-AI collaboration and improved productivity.

The development started with Gemini CLI and continued using Cursor. To maintain context, I first instructed the AI to list all tasks in ACTION_ITEMS.md. The AI then selected tasks from this file and documented completed work in WORK_DONE.md.

To provide additional context, I created API_DOCS.md and DATABASE_SCHEMA.md, and also supplied REQUIREMENTS.md containing the project specifications.

For managing permissions, I prepared PERMISSION.md, which includes the JSON structure used for our RBAC system. This setup allowed the AI to understand project requirements, database structure, APIs, and permissions, enabling it to assist effectively throughout development.
