## Phase 5: Bug Fixes

### Bug Fixes
-  [X] **Frontend Development:**
    -   [X] In "Create New RFP", there is no option to add documents ??? why , while creating RFP, user will surely going to upload documents related to RFP
    -   [X] In "login" and "register" Page, if token is there in the localstorage, please redirect to dashboard page and After "login"& "Register" redirect to dashboard page as well. 
    -   [X] when I am going to "/dashboard" page, why it is redirect me to login page even if token is there, fix this. this is happening for every protected page. check the logic and do it 
    -   [X] In dashboard, why we have different Upload Documents Actions for Buyer to upload documents ?? better is to make them inside "Create New RFP".. why there are two "Review Responses" actions ??? remove one if other one is redudant
    -   [X] While uploading document "file_type" key is mandatory to send from the frontend. please do it.
    -   [X] You have not implemented every detail in RFP details page.... Detail RFP page missing details like deadline, min & max budget etc etc.. RFP detail page should also show us the responses of the RFP given by suppliers... make the RFP detail page looks good.
    -   [X] There is no Edit RFP Functionality, implement that, I think Edit Page is also missing, try to use Add RFP Form as a reusable component
    -   [X] In "RFP Detail Page", If status is published, don't show the "Upload New Documents" as It can't be done in Publish state.
    -   [X] In "My RFPs" Page
        -   [X] Implement Pagination, send "page" and "limit" key to backend
        -   [X] Implement Filters and search properly, to implement filters properly read - "modifyGeneralFilterPrisma" and API controller - "getMyRfps"
        -   [X] We don't have bulk API feature as of now, delete that "Select all" for now
    -   [X] Implement Navbar, either on the left or on the top, whatever u feel like is ideal for the application.
    -   [X] I loggedIn as "Supplier" and in dashboard i can see "Recent RFPs" in which I can see "Draft" RFPs as well. ideally, only "Published should be shown"
    -   [X] If user has the permission "supplier_response" -> "create" is allowed, please show way to upload the response in the "RFP Detail Page".
    -   [X] If user has the permisison "rfp" -> "manage_documents" is allowed, please show the upload new documents, else hide it in "RFP Detail Page"
    -   [X] based on new websocket implementation of event in backend, update frontend accordingly
    -   [X] /responses/create has RFP ID, instead of this, it should have a dropdown of all the published rfps so that user can easily select and give response
    -   [X] /rfps/<rfp_id> page, buyer can see responses that are in draft state as well, this should not be allowed, check permission.md file if there is some issue.
    -   [X] /responses/<responses_id> page, upload new document is visible to buyer too, that's not possible, check permission json, same delete can be done by supplier not buyer, check permission json and make changes 
    -   [X] /responses/<responses_id> page , update the UI, it is missing most of the details
    -   [X] supplier is not able to see draft responses, but buyer can, please check permisison json and update the code neccessary
    -   [X] buyer can publish rfps from /rfps/<rfp_id> page, now this functionality is only in the "rfps/my" page.
    -   [X] same in /responses/<responseId> page, seller can change status draft responses to publish responses. and then it is available and send email to that rfp owner against which response is added, send notification and web socket event also.
    -   [X] on dashboard "RFP Status Distribution" that graph color of bars should be bg-primary do that
      -   [X] Basically, update the "RFP Status Distribution" in dashboard frontend accordingly, with that u might need to update the dashboard/stats api as well in backend.
      -   [X] if on page, responses/<response_id>, if the responses is submitted, then give user to review the response, according to lifecycle. most probably approve or reject actions but check it and then implement. if new is required, do it
      -   [X] page , /rfps/<rfp_id>, if it is in draft state, give user to action to delete
            -   [X] in backend, I have created this "notifyResponseMovedToReview" in websocket.service.ts, please do it on frontend as well.
      -  [X] where I can see buyer or supplier see all of there activities ?? there is a recent activity tab in dashboard but it fetch only first 5 i guess.... implement this feature, in that "Recent Activity" tab, give a Link to a page where user can see all of his activites with pagination implemented.... check backend if backend has the apis, if not create related apis.
      -   [X] make the dialog ui of "Create New RFP Version" good, now it is small and scrollable, put the heading into dialog title and do other relevant things
      -   [X] not able to even go to the "/login" or "/register" page when I am on landing page. please check if login or register page routes accessible or not when user is not logged in 
      -   [X] "/audit" is not accessible, buyer and supplier can access this page and they will see there own audit trails and activities... please make neccessary changes in permission json, frontend and backend.
      -   [X] when awarded, don't send real-time notification saying status change, make correct it say that you have been awarded or something for supplier.
      -   [X] check Landing Page and see if u can make it more attractive, like update pricing section, see if there is any bug in it or not etc etc.
            -   [X] implement pagination in /audit page... user can see it's own audit only. check for any bug in the flow and fix
      -   [X] fix the "rfps/my" filter of budget should be => gte___budget_min = 17000, lte___budget_max = 85000
      -   [X] "responses/my" page, please add backend filters, remove these frontend filters, add pagination if not already added
      -   [X] status filter are not working b.c implementation of status filter is different, as u know we don't store status in schema but have a different tables for them. check schema to know more.... apart from that ... update routes like "getPublishedRfps" , "getMyRfps", "getNBAResponses", "getUserAuditTrails" etc etc where filters can be applied for status...
        
    -   [X] **Backend Deployment:**
      -   [X] In "createRfp" service, u are not creating it correctly, read schema.prisma to get the hang of how the schema is and then implement it, for ex - current_version_id is setting as null, but that should not be the case, versions to get all the versions related to an rpf and general we will fetch only the current_version using current_version_id
      -   [X] In "getRfpById", please all the documents that are related to this "rfp_version_id" and send them to the frontend. do it same for "getMyRfps", include documents that are related to this "rfp_version_id"
      -   [X] Create "Delete Document API", this is not present, make the route => /api/rfp/documents/<document_id>, frontend will send u if the document related to rfp version or response, accordingly send rfp_verion_id or responseId... soft delete documents please....
      -   [X] Why we have not implement version and parent_document_id related to Document.... if parent_document_id is not needed, delete it.... else do something about it. same for version
      -   [X] Create more WebSocket Events, I want to make dashboard a fully functional realtime data
      -   [X] Implement Audit Trail feature as well, read my schema. I have created a table related to Audit and I think this is not implemented, implement this in backend and frontend is needed.
      -   [X] Supplier is not able to see the his responses against a rfp.. this api route is is giving empty - "/:rfp_id/responses". supplier can only see his own created rfp responses, not anybody else. buyer can see responses for the rfp that is created by him.
      -   [X] for supplier, this api is also failing, please check "/rfp/my-responses"... error - "Forbidden: You can only view published RFPs"
      -   [X] For supplier, Recent Responses in dashboard frontend should show reponses, whether draft or published.. api/dashboard check this route API
      -   [X] real-time and email and notification service when buyer mark supplier response "UNDER_REVIEW", "Approved", "REJECTED", "AWARDED" and check others too.. do frontend changes to support these changes as well.
      -   [X] Fix RFP awarding bug: when awarding an RFP, the selected response status should change from "Approved" to "Awarded" along with RFP status change to "Awarded", and send proper notifications (email, WebSocket, in-app) to all suppliers who responded.
      -   [X] We forget the Versioning flow of FRP completely, read "requirements.md" file and implement versioning flow. Our schema at schema.prisma actually supports RFP versioning. Implement Backend and frontend completely and then test it if it's working or not, whether your implementation after done is right or not.
      -   [X] update api-docs.md and update that, plus update docs-schema.md if needed and readme.md ... apart from them... give me a good new .md file explaining everything in brief from frontend till backend everything
      -   [X] improve "email.service.ts" email template, they are too simple, plus move templates to different page to make the file readable... put logo on top and do other neccessary changes
      -   [X] permission json changed, check seed.ts and please refactor the route, controller and service for audit
      -   [X] create docker file for backend to deploy plus create a docker file to start postgres locally.. after starting postgres, seed.ts should be implemented.

## Phase 7: Admin Bug Fix
- [X] check frontend code, I just logged in, it redirected me to dashboard , which is calling api/dashboard that is basically for buyer  / supplier, please check if u are calling right apis or not and 
- [X] change the navigation bar also related to the role, make that navigation dynamic , add these in permisison json and then it will show only those pages from navigation
- [X] When Admin Login, redirect to "/admin" page, this is the default page for admin and for everyone else, "/dashboard"
- [X] Remove the Top Navigation Bar for Admin, only side navigation bar will be seen to admin.
- [X] Integrate APIs into this component <AdminDashboardPage />, create APIs if not exist, use React Query and Axios ( read about how things are implemented in <DashboardPage /> )
- [X] Same, Integrate APIs into the components, create APIs if not exist in backend, admin can share apis, don't need to make every API from scratch, read about current available api's and try to modify there controller or service to support admin page, my suggestion is don't make too much specific apis, make the ones we have more generic, only make a new api when we need it 100%.
    - [X] <UserManagementPage /> - âœ… COMPLETED: Added user management APIs and integrated with real data
    - [X] <AnalyticsPage /> - âœ… COMPLETED: Using existing dashboard APIs with admin role
    - [X] <AuditLogsPage /> - âœ… COMPLETED: Using existing audit APIs with admin role
    - [X] <RfpManagementPage /> - âœ… COMPLETED: Using existing RFP APIs with admin role
- [X] In <AdminDashboardPage />, I am not able to see "Recent Activity" and quick actions are not integrated. 
- [X] why are u mocking data in dashboard.service.ts -         
        // Average response time (mock calculation)
        Promise.resolve('2.3 days'),
        
        // Success rate (mock calculation)
        Promise.resolve('78%'), 
        remove this if we can't find out average response time and success rate, from frontend and backend both, if we can find out, send right data 
- [X] User Management Page,
    - [X] When click on "Create User", form will appear in dialog to create a user, if api don't exist , create one, if exist, use it , check auth.router.ts
    - [X] Implement Pagination for "Users" List if not created now.
    - [X] Implement Debounce when searching Users
    - [X] Action on Users like => "View Details", "Edit", "Activate", "Delete" are not working. implement them, if api exist, great, if not then create apis
    - [X] Create New User, should have Roles field as well, can't create admin users btw
    - [X] Add a new field in "User" Table, call it "status", status can be active and inactive in backend, then run prisma migration and prisma client generation , then create an api to activate or deactivate user, make it a single api , just send actions , different actions based on what u are calling the api with. after that integrate this into the "Activate/Deactivate" Action, update database-schema.md and api-docs.md files as well.
    - [X] Implement a new Stats API for users and integrate it to the User Management Page.
        Api will include the following details -
        1. Total Users
        2. changes in % from last month for users
        3. Active Users
        4. changes in % from last week for users
        5. Total Buyers
        6. Total Suppliers
    -  [X] Implement a dialog and manage it using "handleViewDetails"
    -  [X] Implement a dialog to Delete User rather than showing an alert and asking input based that.
    -  [X] Implement when clicked on "Edit User", same create user form will open but with pre-filled details of the user. when click on submit, edit user api should be called. 
         -  [X] "Create New User" dialog is calling the register user api, that should not be the case, check if admin has an api to create users, if not, create one and use that in frontend. also edit api-docs.md if u make new api
- [X] AdminDashboardPage Changes -
    - [X] Copy the UI for "Recent Activity" from <DashboardPage />
    - [X] "Platform Health" is static, check if it is implemented in backend or not, if not implement it and then use it in frontend.
- [ ] AuditLogsPage Changes -
    - [ ] "Export Logs" Button, we have not integrated anything with this
    - [ ] "getAllAuditTrails" Controller and Service needs to change, make the filters dynamic, read "getAllRfps" controller and service plus "filters.ts" and apply these filters. change frontend accordingly 
- [ ] RfpManagementPage Changes - 
    - [ ] use "RfpForm" component to show as a dialog when clicked on "Create RFP", just add "Buyer" Field for "Admin" role
    - [ ] API "/rfp/all", will return data as well as following stats and integrate them in the frontend Admin page -
        - [ ] Total RFPs
        - [ ] RFPs Published
        - [ ] Total Responses
        - [ ] Awarded RFPs
    - [ ] remove "Schedule Review" Quick Action
    - [ ] Integrate Properly "Award RFPs" and "View Responses"
- [ ] Remove anything related to "Paused" status of RFPs ( search the whole frontend and backend )
