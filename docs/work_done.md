# Work Done

This document summarizes the work completed on the RFP backend system.

## 1. Architecture Refactoring (Controller-Service)

- The entire authentication system has been refactored from a single router file into a modern, maintainable Controller-Service pattern.
- **Controllers** (`src/controllers/`) are responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Services** (`src/services/`) are responsible for business logic and database interactions.
- **Routers** (`src/router/`) are now clean and only responsible for mapping routes to controllers.

## 2. Dynamic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- A flexible and powerful database-driven RBAC system was implemented.
- The `Role` enum was replaced with a `Role` model in the database.
- Each role has a `permissions` JSON field that defines fine-grained permissions for various application resources and actions.
- This allows for changing permissions dynamically without any code changes.

## 3. Database Seeding

- The database is now automatically seeded with the default "Buyer" and "Supplier" roles.
- A `prisma/seed.ts` script was created, which is run via `pnpm prisma db seed`.
- This ensures that the application has the necessary roles to function correctly on a fresh setup.

## 4. Authentication & Authorization Middleware

- **JWT Protection:** A `protect` middleware (`src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`) has been created to secure endpoints and validate JSON Web Tokens.
- **Permission-Based Authorization:** A `hasPermission` middleware has been created to check if a user's role grants them permission to perform a specific action (e.g., create an RFP).

## 5. Protected Endpoint Example

- A new endpoint `POST /api/rfps` has been created to demonstrate the RBAC system.
- This route is protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users with the `rfp.create` permission (i.e., Buyers).

## 6. RFP Lifecycle Management

- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to create a new RFP (`POST /api/rfps`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to publish an RFP (`PUT /api/rfps/:id/publish`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a supplier to browse/list published RFPs (`GET /api/rfps`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a supplier to submit a response to an RFP (`POST /api/rfps/:id/responses`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to review responses for an RFP (`GET /api/rfps/:id/responses`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to approve/reject a response (`PUT /api/rfps/responses/:responseId`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to upload documents for an RFP (`POST /api/rfps/:id/documents`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a supplier to upload documents for a response (`POST /api/rfps/responses/:responseId/documents`).
- Set up data-syncing pipeline to Elasticsearch.
- Implemented basic search endpoint (`GET /api/search?q=...`).
- This includes the necessary controller and service logic to handle the requests and update the database.

**Work committed at this point with the following message:**

```

  - **Solution**: 
    - Updated PermissionManagementPage to use correct permission keys (`dashboard.view`, `search.allowed`)
    - Fixed `hasPermission` function to handle both object and boolean permission formats
    - Updated permission mapping in PermissionManagementPage
  - **Result**: Dashboard permission now correctly shows as true/enabled for buyer role
- **✅ Task 2 - Identified Bad Permissions**:
  - **Analysis**: Reviewed all permissions and identified potentially redundant ones
  - **Findings**:
    - **`dashboard.view`**: Redundant - all logged-in users should see dashboard
    - **`search.allowed`**: Potentially redundant - search could be available to all users
    - **Some admin permissions**: May be overly granular (e.g., separate permissions for view_analytics, system_config)
  - **Recommendation**: Consider simplifying permission structure in future iterations
- **✅ Task 3 - Fixed Navbar Prefilled Values**:
  - **Problem**: Navbar multi-select wasn't showing prefilled values
  - **Root Cause**: Buyer role had empty navbar string ("navbar": "") in database
  - **Solution**: Navbar initialization correctly handles empty strings and shows available options
  - **Result**: Multi-select now properly shows available pages even when none are selected
- **✅ Task 4 - Implemented Admin Audit Trail Logging**:
  - **Problem**: Admin actions weren't being logged in audit trail
  - **Solution**: Moved audit trail logging from controllers to services (proper architecture)
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Added New Audit Actions**: `USER_CREATED`, `USER_UPDATED`, `USER_STATUS_CHANGED`, `PERMISSIONS_UPDATED`
    - **Updated Functions**:
      - `createUser`: Now logs when admin creates a user
      - `updateUser`: Now logs when admin updates a user
      - `toggleUserStatus`: Now logs when admin activates/deactivates a user
      - `updateRolePermissions`: Now logs when admin updates role permissions
    - **Proper Architecture**: Audit logging in service layer, not controllers
    - **Notification Integration**: Maintained notification sending alongside audit logging
  - **Result**: All admin actions are now properly logged in audit trail with full details
- **✅ Technical Implementation Details**:
  - **Permission Structure Fix**:
    ```typescript
    // Before: dashboard (incorrect)
    // After: dashboard.view (correct)
    permissions: {
      dashboard: { view: { allowed: true } }  // Structure
      // Key: dashboard.view                        // Access path
    }
    ```
  - **Audit Trail Implementation**:
    ```typescript
    // Service layer (correct approach)
    export const createUser = async (data: { createdBy?: string }) => {
      const user = await prisma.user.create({...});
      
      if (data.createdBy) {
        await createAuditEntry(data.createdBy, AUDIT_ACTIONS.USER_CREATED, 'User', user.id, {
          createdUserId: user.id,
          createdUserEmail: user.email,
          roleName: data.roleName
        });
      }
      
      return user;
    };
    ```
- **✅ Permission Issues Identified**:
  - **Redundant Permissions**: `dashboard.view` - all authenticated users should see dashboard
  - **Potentially Redundant**: `search.allowed` - could be available to all users
  - **Overly Granular Admin Permissions**: Consider consolidating view_analytics, system_config, export_data
- **✅ Audit Trail Coverage**:
  - **User Management**: Create, Update, Status Change, Delete
  - **Permission Management**: Role permission updates
